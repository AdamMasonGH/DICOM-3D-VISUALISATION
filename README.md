# DICOM-3D-VISUALISATION
# Note: Work in progress. I will add new functions as I go along.

# Personal project involving the processing and segmentation of DICOM Images. For this project, I have used sample DICOM Files provided by the University of Glasgow, but any DICOM files should work fine :-)

# Zip File contains Python Code which loads in DICOM files and visualises the CT/MRI Scan in 3D. Note: the threshold value may need to be changed if visualising MRI scans. The file is approximately 60 MB, so it has been compressed to be able to be uploaded.

# Link to sources used are added throughout.
